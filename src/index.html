        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            We are a group of acroyogi's in the Newport, RI area who are looking
            to practice acro with others. The group consists of people of
            varying experience levels. All are welcome.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently we don't have any classes running the area, but are
            looking to change that. If you know any facilities that would be
            open to hosting a class please reach out to the group on facebook.
        </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            In the summer of 2018, I found myself in Newport looking to do
            Acroyoga. I was in from the Left Coast where acro is far more
            prevalent. There is a good community in Mass and CT, but very little
            acro in Rhode Island. I started this group to try to build a
            community. I am a certified Acroyoga Teacher and former cheerleader.
            I donâ€™t make it to all of the group activities but I do make it a
            bunch of them, and teach some of the local classes. You can find
            information on me at zacryoga.com .
