                h2 History
                p Several summers ago, I found myself in Newport for the summer looking to do Acroyoga. I’m from the Left Coast where acro is far more prevelant. There is a good community in Mass and CT, but very little acro in Rhode Island. I started this group to try to build a community. I am a certified Acroyoga Teacher and former cheerleader. I don’t make it to all of the group activities but I do make it a bunch of them. You can find information on me at
